# Bitstreams_verilog_attempts
 
Contains bitstream files for demonstration of different verilog scripts implemented on a BASYS3 FPGA board. 

The projects are:
- Binary to Decimal converter (input using switches)
- Digital Clock (at 10x speed)
- Digital clock with a led ripple effect to show seconds
- Basic home alarm system using a combinational circuit. Can be improved by adding motion sensors
- Improved home alarm incorporating motion sensors
- A ripple effect for leds to serve as a time keeper
- Snake: a snake animation on the 7 segment display
- ultrasonic distance - an implementation of a distance measuring unit using a HC SR04 sensor with output on LED strip
