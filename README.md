# Bitstreams_verilog_attempts
 
Contains bitstream files for demonstration of different verilog scripts implemented on a BASYS3 FPGA board.

The projects are:
- Digital Clock (at 10x speed)
- Snake: a snake animation on the 7 segment display
- Digital clock with a led ripple effect to show seconds
- Basic home alarm system using a custom combinational circuit.
